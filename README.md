# anie
A personal website powered by react and strapi. It gives the client an option to update the content without knowing what's going on under the hood

---

## Frontend
this folder contains the react app for the frontend

---
## Backend
Used strapi for the backend, so that user has total control over the data used on the site and can update it at any time and more content. Follow the instructions shared below to run the backend:

Step 1 - In the Heroku dashboard:
- Connect github repository to Heroku
- Inside the Deploy tab, scroll to Deployment method and connect your Github account. Find the repo and hit connect. heroku should be authorized as an Oauth app in your github now.
- If you cannot find the repo: Either your github has not authorized Heroku or you did not create this repo and need to make sure you have admin access to it. If this is not possible, invite an admin of the repo to your heroku app by going to Access tab in Heroku Dashboard and adding the admin as a collaborator. The admin then logs into heroku and completes Step 1 here. Afterwards you can finish the following steps.

Step 2) - Set Heroku Config Var PROJECT_PATH to your server folder
  - Inside the Settings tab, set a config var to tell Heroku the path to find the server code you want deployed.
  - Example: lets say your repo name is MyRepo and it has 2 sub-folders. back-end contains a Node.js server and front-end contains a React app. Your github directory looks like this:
    - MyRepo/front-end/package.json
    - MyRepo/back-end/package.json
  - Then you should set your config var to PROJECT_PATH in the left box and back-end in the right box.

Step 3) - Set a Heroku Buildpack that will deploy the PROJECT_PATH folder
  - Again inside the Settings tab, you need to add a Buildpack that will tell heroku to look for your folder instead of deploying the repo root. 
  - There should already be 1 buildpack there to tell heroku what type of server it is (javascript/node.js, python/django, etc...).
  - Enter this url to add buildpack https://github.com/timanovsky/subdir-heroku-buildpack.git and make sure this is at the top of the buildpack chain (drag the lines on the left to make it above any other buildpacks you have added.
  - Make sure node.js is also added under buildpacks

Step 4) - Enable auto deploy
  - Inside the Deploy tab, scroll to Automatic Deploys and click the black button to enable automatic deploys
  - Auto Deploy complete! Now check the build logs and make sure you don't have any errors
